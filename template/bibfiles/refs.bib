These results place simple and easily verifiable hypotheses on the summands, and they deliver strong conclusions about the large-deviation behavior of the maximum eigenvalue of the sum. Tail bounds for the norm of a sum of random rectangular matrices follow as an immediate corollary. The proof techniques also yield some information about matrix-valued martingales."

    abstract = { In this paper classical matrix perturbation theory is approached from a probabilistic point of view. The perturbed quantity is approximated by a first-order perturbation expansion, in which the perturbation is assumed to be random. This permits the computation of statistics estimating the variation in the perturbed quantity. Up to the higher-order terms that are ignored in the expansion, these statistics tend to be more realistic than perturbation bounds obtained in terms of norms. The technique is applied to a number of problems in matrix perturbation theory, including least squares and the eigenvalue problem. }

    abstract = { The classical perturbation theory for Hermitian matrix eigenvalue and singular value problems provides bounds on the absolute differences between approximate eigenvalues (singular values) and the true eigenvalues (singular values) of a matrix. These bounds may be bad news for small eigenvalues (singular values), which thereby suffer worse relative uncertainty than large ones. However, there are situations where even small eigenvalues are determined to high relative accuracy by the data much more accurately than the classical perturbation theory would indicate. In this paper, we study how eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix A change when it is perturbed to \$\wtd A=D^*AD\$, where D is close to a unitary matrix, and how singular values of a (nonsquare) matrix B change when it is perturbed to \$\wtd B=D\_1^*BD\_2\$, where D1 and D2 are nearly unitary. It is proved that under these kinds of perturbations small eigenvalues (singular values) suffer relative changes no worse than large eigenvalues (singular values). Many well-known perturbation theorems, including the Hoffman--Wielandt and Weyl--Lidskii theorems, are extended. }
